Dictionaries
===============

Another key basic object in python is the dictionary.  Dictionaries are iterables, but unlike lists (and tuples if you
got that far) values in a dictionary are indexed by a user specified key rather than a positional argument. the default
structure of a dictionary is {key: value}.  The value can be any object in python (numbers, strings, boolean, lists,
and so on).  Keys are a bit more proscriptive; the rules are a bit more complex, but for beginners it's normally enough
to know that numbers and strings are able to be keys.  For more details on exactly what python objects can be keys in a
diction
Note as of python version 3.6 dictionaries will remembers the order that the data was input.
