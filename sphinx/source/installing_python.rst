Installing python
-------------------

#todo teach people how to build up from dependancies. and give a modular list.

There are a number of ways to install python, but the easiest and the way we are going to install it via Anaconda.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of python and has been build in a way to simplify package management.
There are two ways to install python from Anaconda either 1) simply install Anaconda, which has most of the packages
you may need or 2) install miniconda (a very light weight version) and then add the packages you need.

For this course we recommend installing miniconda and building an environment based on a default set of packages that
we find the most useful for environmental scientists. It's not nearly as complex as it sounds.

1. go to https://conda.io/miniconda.html and download the appropriate python 3.6 installer

2. download the env file.... #todo document with mike

3. some command #todo document with mike

This will give you a python environment which has most of the useful libraries for everything from simple data analysis
to geospatial and GIS programming.
