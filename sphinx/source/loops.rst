There is another type of loop in python called a while loop. A while loop continues to iterate until a condition becomes
 false. For environmental scientists, this loop isn't used that regularly, but it is important to at least know of it's
 existence
# while loop?  I rarely use this; just a brief mention
# include the else statement in teh for loop? I don't think i've ever used this; NO!
